# Learning Rust, Project 1: Hangman

## Intro

One of the exercises that I found most useful in "Haskell programming
from first principles" was where I was required to build a command
line hangman game. I think the appeal was that although it was a
trivial problem there was enough meat to it that you were required to
use a reasonable amount of the language.

Rust is just alien enough I don't have a feel for what the best way to
structure things are and hangman feels like a good level of problem for
puzzling some of that out.

The things i'm hoping to touch on

* Organisation of code and the module system
* Tests
* File IO
* Using external crates
* Documentation
* Parsing command line args

I suspect that the level of these blog posts will be pretty basic, I'm
still very much a rust newbie. I'm hoping though, that by forcing
myself to articulate what I'm doing and why I'll be able to
solidify my understanding of these areas (analogous to the way that
training someone else is great way of improving your own knowledge of
a subject).
